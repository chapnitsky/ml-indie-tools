      "No one succeeds in obtaining a prominent place in literature, or in\n",
      "surrounding himself with a faithful and steady circle of admirers drawn\n",
      "from the fickle masses of the public, unless he possesses originality,\n",
      "constant variety, and a distinct personality.  It is quite possible to\n",
      "gain for a moment a few readers by imitating some original feature in\n",
      "another; but these soon vanish and the writer remains alone and\n",
      "forgotten.  Others, again, without belonging to any distinct group of\n",
      "authors, having found their standard in themselves, moralists and\n",
      "educators at the same time, have obtained undying recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the latter class, though little known outside of France, is Emile\n",
      "Souvestre, who was born in Morlaix, April 15, 1806, and died at Paris\n",
      "July 5, 1854.  He was the son of a civil engineer, was educated at the\n",
      "college of Pontivy, and intended to follow his father's career by\n",
      "entering the Polytechnic School.  His father, however, died in 1823, and\n",
      "Souvestre matriculated as a law-student at Rennes.  But the young student\n",
      "soon devoted himself entirely to literature.  His first essay, a tragedy,\n",
      "'Le Siege de Missolonghi' (1828), was a pronounced failure.  Disheartened\n",
      "and disgusted he left Paris and established himself first as a lawyer in\n",
      "Morlaix.  Then he became proprietor of a newspaper, and was afterward\n",
      "appointed a professor in Brest and in Mulhouse.  In 1836 he contributed\n",
      "to the 'Revue des Deux Mondes' some sketches of life in Brittany, which\n",
      "obtained a brilliant success.  Souvestre was soon made editor of La Revue\n",
      "de Paris, and in consequence early found a publisher for his first novel,\n",
      "'L'Echelle de Femmes', which, as was the case with his second work,\n",
      "Riche et Pauvre', met with a very favorable reception.  His reputation\n",
      "was now made, and between this period and his death he gave to France\n",
      "about sixty volumes--tales, novels, essays, history, and drama.\n",
      "\n",
      "A double purpose was always very conspicuous in his books: he aspired to\n",
      "the role of a moralist and educator, and was likewise a most impressive\n",
      "painter of the life, character, and morals of the inhabitants of\n",
      "Brittany.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most significant of his books are perhaps 'Les Derniers Bretons\n",
      "(1835-1837, 4 vols.), Pierre Landais (1843, 2 vols.), Le Foyer Breton\n",
      "(1844, 2 vols.), Un Philosophe sons les Toits, crowned by the Academy\n",
      "(1850), Confessions d'un Ouvrier (1851), Recits et Souvenirs (1853),\n",
      "Souvenirs d'un Vieillard (1854); also La Bretagne Pittoresque (1845),\n",
      "and, finally, Causeries Historiques et Litteraires (1854, 2 vols.)'.  His\n",
      "comedies deserve honorable mention: 'Henri Hamelin, L'Oncle Baptiste\n",
      "(1842), La Parisienne, Le Mousse, etc'.  In 1848, Souvestre was appointed\n",
      "professor of the newly created school of administration, mostly devoted\n",
      "to popular lectures.  He held this post till 1853, lecturing partly in\n",
      "Paris, partly in Switzerland.\n",
      "\n",
      "His death, when comparatively young, left a distinct gap in the literary\n",
      "world.  A life like his could not be extinguished without general sorrow.\n",
      "Although he was unduly modest, and never aspired to the role of a beacon-\n",
      "light in literature, always seeking to remain in obscurity, the works of\n",
      "Emile Souvestre must be placed in the first rank by their morality and by\n",
      "their instructive character.  They will always command the entire respect\n",
      "and applause of mankind.  And thus it happens that, like many others, he\n",
      "was only fully appreciated after his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even those of his 'confreres' who did not seem to esteem him, when alive,\n",
      "suddenly found out that they had experienced a great loss in his demise.\n",
      "They expressed it in emotional panegyrcs; contemporaneous literature\n",
      "discovered that virtue had flown from its bosom, and the French Academy,\n",
      "which had at its proper time crowned his 'Philosophe sons les Toits' as a\n",
      "work contributing supremely to morals, kept his memory green by bestowing\n",
      "on his widow the \"Prix Lambert,\" designed for the \"families of authors\n",

      "The crowd hasten to welcome her young sister.  But while all looks are\n",
      "turned toward the future, mine revert to the past.  Everyone smiles upon\n",
      "the new queen; but, in spite of myself, I think of her whom time has just\n",
      "wrapped in her winding-sheet.  The past year!--at least I know what she\n",
      "was, and what she has given me; while this one comes surrounded by all\n",
      "the forebodings of the unknown.  What does she hide in the clouds that\n",
      "mantle her?  Is it the storm or the sunshine?  Just now it rains, and I\n",
      "feel my mind as gloomy as the sky.  I have a holiday today; but what can\n",
      "one do on a rainy day?  I walk up and down my attic out of temper, and I\n",
      "determine to light my fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately the matches are bad, the chimney smokes, the wood goes out!\n",
      "I throw down my bellows in disgust, and sink into my old armchair.\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth, why should I rejoice to see the birth of a new year?  All those\n",
      "who are already in the streets, with holiday looks and smiling faces--do\n",
      "they understand what makes them so gay?  Do they even know what is the\n",
      "meaning of this holiday, or whence comes the custom of New-Year's gifts?\n",
      "\n",
      "Here my mind pauses to prove to itself its superiority over that of the\n",
      "vulgar.  I make a parenthesis in my ill-temper in favor of my vanity, and\n",
      "I bring together all the evidence which my knowledge can produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "(The old Romans divided the year into ten months only; it was Numa\n",
      "Pompilius who added January and February.  The former took its name from\n",
      "Janus, to whom it was dedicated.  As it opened the new year, they\n",
      "surrounded its beginning with good omens, and thence came the custom of\n",
      "visits between neighbors, of wishing happiness, and of New-Year's gifts.\n",
      "The presents given by the Romans were symbolic.  They consisted of dry\n",
      "figs, dates, honeycomb, as emblems of \"the sweetness of the auspices\n",
      "under which the year should begin its course,\" and a small piece of money\n",
      "called stips, which foreboded riches.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Here I close the parenthesis, and return to my ill-humor.  The little\n",
      "speech I have just addressed to myself has restored me my self-\n",
      "satisfaction, but made me more dissatisfied with others.  I could now\n",
      "enjoy my breakfast; but the portress has forgotten my morning's milk, and\n",
      "the pot of preserves is empty!  Anyone else would have been vexed: as for\n",
      "me, I affect the most supreme indifference.  There remains a hard crust,\n",
      "which I break by main strength, and which I carelessly nibble, as a man\n",
      "far above the vanities of the world and of fresh rolls.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I do not know why my thoughts should grow more gloomy by reason\n",
      "of the difficulties of mastication.  I once read the story of an\n",
      "Englishman who hanged himself because they had brought him his tea\n",
      "without sugar.  There are hours in life when the most trifling cross\n",
      "takes the form of a calamity.  Our tempers are like an opera-glass, which\n",
      "makes the object small or great according to the end you look through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually, the prospect that opens out before my window delights me.  It is\n",
      "a mountain-range of roofs, with ridges crossing, interlacing, and piled\n",
      "on one another, and upon which tall chimneys raise their peaks.  It was\n",
      "but yesterday that they had an Alpine aspect to me, and I waited for the\n",
      "first snowstorm to see glaciers among them; to-day, I only see tiles and\n",
      "stone flues.  The pigeons, which assisted my rural illusions, seem no\n",
      "more than miserable birds which have mistaken the roof for the back yard;\n",
      "the smoke, which rises in light clouds, instead of making me dream of the\n",
      "panting of Vesuvius, reminds me of kitchen preparations and dishwater;\n",
      "and lastly, the telegraph, that I see far off on the old tower of\n",
      "Montmartre, has the effect of a vile gallows stretching its arms over the\n",
      "city.\n",
      "\n",
      "My eyes, thus hurt by all they meet, fall upon the great man's house\n",
      "which faces my attic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The influence of New-Year's Day is visible there.  The servants have an\n",
      "air of eagerness proportioned to the value of their New-Year's gifts,\n",
      "received or expected.  I see the master of the house crossing the court\n",
      "with the morose look of a man who is forced to be generous; and the\n",
      "visitors increase, followed by shop porters who carry flowers, bandboxes,\n",
      "or toys.  Suddenly the great gates are opened, and a new carriage, drawn\n",
      "by thoroughbred horses, draws up before the doorsteps.  They are, without\n",
      "doubt, the New-Year's gift presented to the mistress of the house by her\n",
      "husband; for she comes herself to look at the new equipage.  Very soon\n",
      "she gets into it with a little girl, all streaming with laces, feathers\n",
      "and velvets, and loaded with parcels which she goes to distribute as New-\n",
      "Year's gifts.  The door is shut, the windows are drawn up, the carriage\n",
      "sets off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus all the world are exchanging good wishes and presents to-day.  I\n",
      "alone have nothing to give or to receive.  Poor Solitary!  I do not even\n",
      "know one chosen being for whom I might offer a prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then let my wishes for a happy New Year go and seek out all my unknown\n",
      "friends--lost in the multitude which murmurs like the ocean at my feet!\n",

      "To you first, hermits in cities, for whom death and poverty have created\n",
      "a solitude in the midst of the crowd!  unhappy laborers, who are\n",
      "condemned to toil in melancholy, and eat your daily bread in silence and\n",
      "desertion, and whom God has withdrawn from the intoxicating pangs of love\n",
      "and friendship!\n",
      "\n",
      "To you, fond dreamers, who pass through life with your eyes turned toward\n",

      "of reality!\n",
      "\n",
      "To you, honest fathers, who lengthen out the evening to maintain your\n",

      "young men, resolutely set to open for yourselves a path in life, large\n",
      "enough to lead through it the wife of your choice! to you, all brave\n",
      "soldiers of work and of self-sacrifice!\n",
      "\n",
      "To you, lastly, whatever your title and your name, who love good, who\n",

      "of Byzantium, with both arms open to the human race!\n",
      "\n",
      "Here I am suddenly interrupted by loud and increasing chirpings.  I look\n",
      "about me: my window is surrounded with sparrows picking up the crumbs of\n",
      "bread which in my brown study I had just scattered on the roof.  At this\n",
      "sight a flash of light broke upon my saddened heart.  I deceived myself\n",
      "just now, when I complained that I had nothing to give: thanks to me, the\n",
      "sparrows of this part of the town will have their New-Year's gifts!\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelve o'clock.--A knock at my door; a poor girl comes in, and greets me\n",
      "by name.  At first I do not recollect her; but she looks at me, and\n",
      "smiles.  Ah! it is Paulette!  But it is almost a year since I have seen\n",
      "her, and Paulette is no longer the same: the other day she was a child,\n",
      "now she is almost a young woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paulette is thin, pale, and miserably clad; but she has always the same\n",
      "open and straightforward look--the same mouth, smiling at every word, as\n",
      "if to court your sympathy--the same voice, somewhat timid, yet expressing\n",
      "fondness.  Paulette is not pretty--she is even thought plain; as for me,\n",
      "I think her charming.  Perhaps that is not on her account, but on my own.\n",
      "Paulette appears to me as one of my happiest recollections.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the evening of a public holiday.  Our principal buildings were\n",
      "illuminated with festoons of fire, a thousand flags waved in the night\n",
      "winds, and the fireworks had just shot forth their spouts of flame into\n",
      "the midst of the Champ de Mars.  Suddenly, one of those unaccountable\n",
      "alarms which strike a multitude with panic fell upon the dense crowd:\n",
      "they cry out, they rush on headlong; the weaker ones fall, and the\n",
      "frightened crowd tramples them down in its convulsive struggles.  I\n",
      "escaped from the confusion by a miracle, and was hastening away, when the\n",
      "cries of a perishing child arrested me: I reentered that human chaos,\n",
      "and, after unheard-of exertions, I brought Paulette out of it at the\n",
      "peril of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was two years ago: since then I had not seen the child again but at\n",
      "long intervals, and I had almost forgotten her; but Paulette's memory was\n",
      "that of a grateful heart, and she came at the beginning of the year to\n",
      "offer me her wishes for my happiness.  She brought me, besides, a\n",
      "wallflower in full bloom; she herself had planted and reared it: it was\n",
      "something that belonged wholly to herself; for it was by her care, her\n",
      "perseverance, and her patience, that she had obtained it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wallflower had grown in a common pot; but Paulette, who is a bandbox-\n",
      "maker, had put it into a case of varnished paper, ornamented with\n",
      "arabesques.  These might have been in better taste, but I did not feel\n",
      "the attention and good-will the less.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unexpected present, the little girl's modest blushes, the\n",
      "compliments she stammered out, dispelled, as by a sunbeam, the kind of\n",
      "mist which had gathered round my mind; my thoughts suddenly changed from\n",
      "the leaden tints of evening to the brightest colors of dawn.  I made\n",
      "Paulette sit down, and questioned her with a light heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first the little girl replied in monosyllables; but very soon the\n",
      "tables were turned, and it was I who interrupted with short interjections\n",
      "her long and confidential talk.  The poor child leads a hard life.  She\n",
      "was left an orphan long since, with a brother and sister, and lives with\n",
      "an old grandmother, who has \"brought them up to poverty,\" as she always\n",
      "calls it.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Paulette now helps her to make bandboxes, her little sister\n",
      "Perrine begins to use the needle, and her brother Henry is apprentice to\n",
      "a printer.  All would go well if it were not for losses and want of work\n",
      "--if it were not for clothes which wear out, for appetites which grow\n",
      "larger, and for the winter, when you cannot get sunshine for nothing.\n",
      "Paulette complains that her candles go too quickly, and that her wood\n",
      "costs too much.  The fireplace in their garret is so large that a fagot\n",
      "makes no more show in it than a match; it is so near the roof that the\n",
      "wind blows the rain down it, and in winter it hails upon the hearth; so\n",
      "they have left off using it.  Henceforth they must be content with an\n",
      "earthen chafing-dish, upon which they cook their meals.  The grandmother\n",
      "had often spoken of a stove that was for sale at the broker's close by;\n",
      "but he asked seven francs for it, and the times are too hard for such an\n",
      "expense: the family, therefore, resign themselves to cold for economy!\n",
      "\n",
      "As Paulette spoke, I felt more and more that I was losing my fretfulness\n",
      "and low spirits.  The first disclosures of the little bandbox-maker\n",
      "created within me a wish that soon became a plan.  I questioned her about\n",
      "her daily occupations, and she informed me that on leaving me she must\n",
      "go, with her brother, her sister, and grandmother, to the different\n",

      "fresh thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I placed the wallflower in the open window, where a ray of sunshine bid\n",
      "it welcome; the birds were singing around, the sky had cleared up, and\n",
      "the day, which began so loweringly, had become bright.  I sang as I moved\n",
      "about my room, and, having hastily put on my hat and coat, I went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three o'clock.--All is settled with my neighbor, the chimney-doctor;\n",
      "he will repair my old stove, and answers for its being as good as new.\n",
      "At five o'clock we are to set out, and put it up in Paulette's\n",
      "grandmother's room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Midnight.--All has gone off well.  At the hour agreed upon, I was at the\n",

      "fixed the stove, while I arranged a dozen logs in the great fireplace,\n",
      "taken from my winter stock.  I shall make up for them by warming myself\n",
      "with walking, or by going to bed earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart beat at every step that was heard on the staircase; I trembled\n",
      "lest they should interrupt me in my preparations, and should thus spoil\n",
      "my intended surprise.  But no!--see everything ready: the lighted stove\n",
      "murmurs gently, the little lamp burns upon the table, and a bottle of oil\n",
      "for it is provided on the shelf.  The chimney-doctor is gone.  Now my\n",
      "fear lest they should come is changed into impatience at their not\n",
      "coming.  At last I hear children's voices; here they are: they push open\n",
      "the door and rush in--but they all stop in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sight of the lamp, the stove, and the visitor, who stands there\n",
      "like a magician in the midst of these wonders, they draw back almost\n",
      "frightened.  Paulette is the first to comprehend it, and the arrival of\n",
      "the grandmother, who is more slowly mounting the stairs, finishes the\n",
      "explanation.  Then come tears, ecstasies, thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "But the wonders are not yet ended.  The little sister opens the oven, and\n",
      "discovers some chestnuts just roasted; the grandmother puts her hand on\n",
      "the bottles of cider arranged on the dresser; and I draw forth from the\n",
      "basket that I have hidden a cold tongue, a pot of butter, and some fresh\n",
      "rolls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now their wonder turns into admiration; the little family have never seen\n",
      "such a feast!  They lay the cloth, they sit down, they eat; it is a\n",
      "complete banquet for all, and each contributes his share to it.  I had\n",
      "brought only the supper: and the bandbox-maker and her children supplied\n",
      "the enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "What bursts of laughter at nothing!  What a hubbub of questions which\n",
      "waited for no reply, of replies which answered no question!  The old\n",
      "woman herself shared in the wild merriment of the little ones!  I have\n",
      "always been struck at the ease with which the poor forget their\n",
      "wretchedness.  Being used to live only for the present, they make a gain\n",
      "of every pleasure as soon as it offers itself.  But the surfeited rich\n",
      "are more difficult to satisfy: they require time and everything to suit\n",
      "before they will consent to be happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening has passed like a moment.  The old woman told me the history\n",
      "of her life, sometimes smiling, sometimes drying her eyes.  Perrine sang\n",
      "an old ballad with her fresh young voice.  Henry told us what he knows of\n",
      "the great writers of the day, to whom he has to carry their proofs.  At\n",
      "last we were obliged to separate, not without fresh thanks on the part of\n",
      "the happy family.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have come home slowly, ruminating with a full heart, and pure\n",
      "enjoyment, on the simple events of my evening.  It has given me much\n",
      "comfort and much instruction.  Now, no New-Year's Day will come amiss to\n",
      "me; I know that no one is so unhappy as to have nothing to give and\n",
      "nothing to receive.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I came in, I met my rich neighbor's new equipage.  She, too, had just\n",

      "THE CARNIVAL\n",
      "\n",
      "February 20th\n",
      "\n",
      "What a noise out of doors!  What is the meaning of these shouts and\n",
      "cries?  Ah! I recollect: this is the last day of the Carnival, and the\n",
      "maskers are passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christianity has not been able to abolish the noisy bacchanalian\n",
      "festivals of the pagan times, but it has changed the names.  That which\n",
      "it has given to these \"days of liberty\" announces the ending of the\n",
      "feasts, and the month of fasting which should follow; carn-ival means,\n",
      "literally, \"farewell to flesh!\"  It is a forty days' farewell to the\n",
      "\"blessed pullets and fat hams,\" so celebrated by Pantagruel's minstrel.\n",
      "Man prepares for privation by satiety, and finishes his sin thoroughly\n",
      "before he begins to repent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, in all ages and among every people, do we meet with some one of\n",
      "these mad festivals?  Must we believe that it requires such an effort for\n",
      "men to be reasonable, that the weaker ones have need of rest at\n",
      "intervals?  The monks of La Trappe, who are condemned to silence by their\n",
      "rule, are allowed to speak once in a month, and on this day they all talk\n",
      "at once from the rising to the setting of the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it is the same in the world.  As we are obliged all the year to\n",
      "be decent, orderly, and reasonable, we make up for such a long restraint\n",
      "during the Carnival.  It is a door opened to the incongruous fancies and\n",
      "wishes that have hitherto been crowded back into a corner of our brain.\n",
      "For a moment the slaves become the masters, as in the days of the\n",
      "Saturnalia, and all is given up to the \"fools of the family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The shouts in the square redouble; the troops of masks increase--on foot,\n",
      "in carriages, and on horseback.  It is now who can attract the most\n",
      "attention by making a figure for a few hours, or by exciting curiosity\n",
      "or envy; to-morrow they will all return, dull and exhausted, to the\n",
      "employments and troubles of yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas!  thought I with vexation, each of us is like these masqueraders;\n",
      "our whole life is often but an unsightly Carnival!  And yet man has need\n",
      "of holidays, to relax his mind, rest his body, and open his heart.  Can\n",
      "he not have them, then, with these coarse pleasures?  Economists have\n",
      "been long inquiring what is the best disposal of the industry of the\n",
      "human race.  Ah!  if I could only discover the best disposal of its\n",
      "leisure!  It is easy enough to find it work; but who will find it\n",
      "relaxation?  Work supplies the daily bread; but it is cheerfulness that\n",
      "gives it a relish.  O philosophers!  go in quest of pleasure!  find us\n",
      "amusements without brutality, enjoyments without selfishness; in a word,\n",
      "invent a Carnival that will please everybody, and bring shame to no one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Three o'clock.--I have just shut my window, and stirred up my fire.  As\n",
      "this is a holiday for everybody, I will make it one for myself, too.  So\n",
      "I light the little lamp over which, on grand occasions, I make a cup of\n",
      "the coffee that my portress's son brought from the Levant, and I look in\n",
      "my bookcase for one of my favorite authors.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, here is the amusing parson of Meudon; but his characters are too\n",
      "fond of talking slang:--Voltaire; but he disheartens men by always\n",
      "bantering them:--Moliere; but he hinders one's laughter by making one\n",
      "think:--Lesage; let us stop at him.  Being profound rather than grave, he\n",
      "preaches virtue while ridiculing vice; if bitterness is sometimes to be\n",
      "found in his writings, it is always in the garb of mirth: he sees the\n",
      "miseries of the world without despising it, and knows its cowardly tricks\n",
      "without hating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us call up all the heroes of his book....  Gil Blas, Fabrice,\n",
      "Sangrado, the Archbishop of Granada, the Duke of Lerma, Aurora, Scipio!\n",
      "Ye gay or graceful figures, rise before my eyes, people my solitude;\n",
      "bring hither for my amusement the world-carnival, of which you are the\n",
      "brilliant maskers!\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, at the very moment I made this invocation, I recollected\n",
      "I had a letter to write which could not be put off.  One of my attic\n",
      "neighbors came yesterday to ask me to do it.  He is a cheerful old man,\n",
      "and has a passion for pictures and prints.  He comes home almost every\n",
      "day with a drawing or painting--probably of little value; for I know he\n",
      "lives penuriously, and even the letter that I am to write for him shows\n",
      "his poverty.  His only son, who was married in England, is just dead, and\n",
      "his widow--left without any means, and with an old mother and a child--\n",
      "had written to beg for a home.  M. Antoine asked me first to translate\n",
      "the letter, and then to write a refusal.  I had promised that he should\n",
      "have this answer to-day: before everything, let us fulfil our promises.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sheet of \"Bath\" paper is before me, I have dipped my pen into the\n",
      "ink, and I rub my forehead to invite forth a sally of ideas, when I\n",
      "perceive that I have not my dictionary.  Now, a Parisian who would speak\n",
      "English without a dictionary is like a child without leading-strings; the\n",
      "ground trembles under him, and he stumbles at the first step.  I run then\n",
      "to the bookbinder's, where I left my Johnson, who lives close by in the\n",
      "square.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door is half open; I hear low groans; I enter without knocking,\n",
      "and I see the bookbinder by the bedside of his fellow-lodger.  This\n",
      "latter has a violent fever and delirium.  Pierre looks at him perplexed\n",
      "and out of humor.  I learn from him that his comrade was not able to get\n",
      "up in the morning, and that since then he has become worse every hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ask whether they have sent for a doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, indeed!\"  replied Pierre, roughly; \"one must have money in\n",
      "one's pocket for that, and this fellow has only debts instead of\n",
      "savings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you,\" said I, rather astonished; \"are you not his friend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friend!\"  interrupted the bookbinder.  \"Yes, as much as the shaft-horse\n",
      "is friend to the leader--on condition that each will take his share of\n",
      "the draught, and eat his feed by himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do not intend, however, to leave him without any help?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bah! he may keep in his bed till to-morrow, as I'm going to the ball.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean to leave him alone?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well! must I miss a party of pleasure at Courtville--[A Parisian summer\n",
      "resort.]--because this fellow is lightheaded?\"  asked Pierre, sharply.\n",
      "\"I have promised to meet some friends at old Desnoyer's.  Those who are\n",
      "sick may take their broth; my physic is white wine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he untied a bundle, out of which he took the fancy costume of\n",
      "a waterman, and proceeded to dress himself in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain I tried to awaken some fellow-feeling for the unfortunate man who\n",
      "lay groaning there close by him; being entirely taken up with the\n",
      "thoughts of his expected pleasure, Pierre would hardly so much as hear\n",
      "me.  At last his coarse selfishness provoked me.  I began reproaching\n",
      "instead of remonstrating with him, and I declared him responsible for the\n",
      "consequences which such a desertion must bring upon the sick man.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the bookbinder, who was just going, stopped with an oath, and\n",
      "stamped his foot.  \"Am I to spend my Carnival in heating water for\n",
      "footbaths, pray?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must not leave your comrade to die without help!\"  I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let him go to the hospital, then!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can he by himself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre seemed to make up his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'm going to take him,\" resumed he; \"besides, I shall get rid of\n",
      "him sooner.  Come, get up, comrade!\"  He shook his comrade, who had not\n",
      "taken off his clothes.  I observed that he was too weak to walk, but the\n",
      "bookbinder would not listen: he made him get up, and half dragged, half\n",
      "supported him to the lodge of the porter, who ran for a hackney carriage.\n",
      "I saw the sick man get into it, almost fainting, with the impatient\n",
      "waterman; and they both set off, one perhaps to die, the other to dine at\n",
      "Courtville Gardens!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Six o'clock.--I have been to knock at my neighbor's door, who opened it\n",
      "himself; and I have given him his letter, finished at last, and directed\n",
      "to his son's widow.  M. Antoine thanked me gratefully, and made me sit\n",
      "down.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the first time I had been into the attic of the old amateur.\n",
      "Curtains stained with damp and hanging down in rags, a cold stove, a bed\n",
      "of straw, two broken chairs, composed all the furniture.  At the end of\n",
      "the room were a great number of prints in a heap, and paintings without\n",
      "frames turned against the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment I came in, the old man was making his dinner on some hard\n",
      "crusts of bread, which he was soaking in a glass of 'eau sucree'.  He\n",
      "perceived that my eyes fell upon his hermit fare, and he looked a little\n",
      "ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is nothing to tempt you in my supper, neighbor,\" said he, with a\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "I replied that at least I thought it a very philosophical one for the\n",
      "Carnival.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Antoine shook his head, and went on again with his supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Every one keeps his holidays in his own way,\" resumed he, beginning\n",
      "again to dip a crust into his glass.  \"There are several sorts of\n",
      "epicures, and not all feasts are meant to regale the palate; there are\n",
      "some also for the ears and the eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked involuntarily round me, as if to seek for the invisible banquet\n",
      "which could make up to him for such a supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without doubt he understood me; for he got up slowly, and, with the\n",
      "magisterial air of a man confident in what he is about to do, he rummaged\n",
      "behind several picture frames, drew forth a painting, over which he\n",
      "passed his hand, and silently placed it under the light of the lamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "It represented a fine-looking old man, seated at table with his wife, his\n",
      "daughter, and his children, and singing to the accompaniment of musicians\n",
      "who appeared in the background.  At first sight I recognized the subject,\n",
      "which I had often admired at the Louvre, and I declared it to be a\n",
      "splendid copy of Jordaens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A copy!\"  cried M. Antoine; \"say an original, neighbor, and an original\n",
      "retouched by Rubens!  Look closer at the head of the old man, the dress\n",
      "of the young woman, and the accessories.  One can count the pencil-\n",
      "strokes of the Hercules of painters.  It is not only a masterpiece, sir;\n",
      "it is a treasure--a relic!  The picture at the Louvre may be a pearl,\n",
      "this is a diamond!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And resting it against the stove, so as to place it in the best light,\n",
      "he fell again to soaking his crusts, without taking his eyes off the\n",
      "wonderful picture.  One would have said that the sight of it gave the\n",
      "crusts an unexpected relish, for he chewed them slowly, and emptied his\n",
      "glass by little sips.  His shrivelled features became smooth, his\n",
      "nostrils expanded; it was indeed, as he said himself, \"a feast for the\n",
      "eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see that I also have my treat,\" he resumed, nodding his head with an\n",
      "air of triumph.  \"Others may run after dinners and balls; as for me, this\n",
      "is the pleasure I give myself for my Carnival.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if this painting is really so precious,\" replied I, \"it ought to be\n",
      "worth a high price.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh! eh!\"  said M. Antoine, with an air of proud indifference.  \"In good\n",
      "times, a good judge might value it at somewhere about twenty thousand\n",
      "francs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I started back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you have bought it?\"  cried I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For nothing,\" replied he, lowering his voice.  \"These brokers are asses;\n",
      "mine mistook this for a student's copy; he let me have it for fifty\n",
      "louis, ready money!  This morning I took them to him, and now he wishes\n",
      "to be off the bargain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This morning!\"  repeated I, involuntarily casting my eyes on the letter\n",
      "containing the refusal that M. Antoine had made me write to his son's\n",
      "widow, which was still on the little table.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took no notice of my exclamation, and went on contemplating the work\n",
      "of Jordaens in an ecstasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a knowledge of chiaroscuro!\"  he murmured, biting his last crust in\n",
      "delight.  \"What relief! what fire!  Where can one find such transparency\n",
      "of color! such magical lights! such force! such nature!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was listening to him in silence, he mistook my astonishment for\n",
      "admiration, and clapped me on the shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are dazzled,\" said he merrily; \"you did not expect such a treasure!\n",
      "What do you say to the bargain I have made?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me,\" replied I, gravely; \"but I think you might have done\n",
      "better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Antoine raised his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How!\" cried he; \"do you take me for a man likely to be deceived about\n",
      "the merit or value of a painting?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I neither doubt your taste nor your skill; but I cannot help thinking\n",
      "that, for the price of this picture of a family party, you might have\n",
      "had--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The family itself, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The old amateur cast a look at me, not of anger, but of contempt.\n",
      "In his eyes I had evidently just proved myself a barbarian, incapable of\n",
      "understanding the arts, and unworthy of enjoying them.  He got up without\n",
      "answering me, hastily took up the Jordaens, and replaced it in its\n",
      "hiding-place behind the prints.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sort of dismissal; I took leave of him, and went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven o'clock.--When I come in again, I find my water boiling over my\n",
      "lamp, and I busy myself in grinding my Mocha, and setting out my coffee-\n",
      "things.\n",
      "\n",
      "The getting coffee ready is the most delicate and most attractive of\n",
      "domestic operations to one who lives alone: it is the grand work of a\n",
      "bachelor's housekeeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coffee is, so to say, just the mid-point between bodily and spiritual\n",
      "nourishment.  It acts agreeably, and at the same time, upon the senses\n",
      "and the thoughts.  Its very fragrance gives a sort of delightful activity\n",
      "to the wits; it is a genius that lends wings to our fancy, and transports\n",
      "it to the land of the Arabian Nights.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I am buried in my old easy-chair, my feet on the fender before a\n",
      "blazing fire, my ear soothed by the singing of the coffee-pot, which\n",
      "seems to gossip with my fire-irons, the sense of smell gently excited by\n",
      "the aroma of the Arabian bean, and my eyes shaded by my cap pulled down\n",
      "over them, it often seems as if each cloud of the fragrant steam took a\n",
      "distinct form.  As in the mirages of the desert, in each as it rises, I\n",

      "\n",
      "Although alone in the midst of the smiling multitude, I do not feel\n",

      "of the English Parliament before their eyes; they have become acquainted\n",

      "But this variety of exhibitions, which makes Paris the fair of the world,\n",

      "pictures do we sketch!  I never look at that shop near the Chinese baths,\n",
      "with its tapestry hangings of Florida jessamine, and filled with\n",

      "Then, when this study of things and this discourse of reason begin to\n",
      "tire you, look around you!  What contrasts of figures and faces you see\n",
      "in the crowd!  What a vast field for the exercise of meditation!  A half-\n",
      "seen glance, or a few words caught as the speaker passes by, open a\n",

      "\n",
      "Alas!  as I was just now passing by the carriage-entrance of a great\n",

      "hat for the charity of those who passed.  His threadbare coat had that\n",
      "look of neatness which marks that destitution has been met by a long\n",
      "struggle.  He had carefully buttoned it up to hide the want of a shirt.\n",
      "His face was half hid under his gray hair, and his eyes were closed, as\n",
      "if he wished to escape the sight of his own humiliation, and he remained\n",
      "mute and motionless.  Those who passed him took no notice of the beggar,\n",
      "who sat in silence and darkness!  They had been so lucky as to escape\n",
      "complaints and importunities, and were glad to turn away their eyes too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the great gate turned on its hinges; and a very low carriage,\n",
      "lighted with silver lamps and drawn by two black horses, came slowly out,\n",
      "and took the road toward the Faubourg St. Germain.  I could just\n",
      "distinguish, within, the sparkling diamonds and the flowers of a ball-\n",
      "dress; the glare of the lamps passed like a bloody streak over the pale\n",
      "face of the beggar, and showed his look as his eyes opened and followed\n",
      "the rich man's equipage until it disappeared in the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dropped a small piece of money into the hat he was holding out, and\n",
      "passed on quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had just fallen unexpectedly upon the two saddest secrets of the\n",
      "disease which troubles the age we live in: the envious hatred of him who\n",
      "suffers want, and the selfish forgetfulness of him who lives in\n",
      "affluence.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the enjoyment of my walk was gone; I left off looking about me, and\n",
      "retired into my own heart.  The animated and moving sight in the streets\n",
      "gave place to inward meditation upon all the painful problems which have\n",
      "been written for the last four thousand years at the bottom of each human\n",
      "struggle, but which are propounded more clearly than ever in our days.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pondered on the uselessness of so many contests, in which defeat and\n",
      "victory only displace each other by turns, and on the mistaken zealots\n",
      "who have repeated from generation to generation the bloody history of\n",
      "Cain and Abel; and, saddened with these mournful reflections, I walked on\n",

      "\n",
      "I had reached one of the remote streets, in which those who would live in\n",
      "comfort and without ostentation, and who love serious reflection, delight\n",
      "to find a home.  There were no shops along the dimly lighted street; one\n",
      "heard no sounds but of distant carriages, and of the steps of some of the\n",
      "inhabitants returning quietly home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I instantly recognized the street, though I had been there only once\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was two years ago.  I was walking at the time by the side of the\n",
      "Seine, to which the lights on the quays and bridges gave the aspect of a\n",
      "lake surrounded by a garland of stars; and I had reached the Louvre, when\n",
      "I was stopped by a crowd collected near the parapet they had gathered\n",
      "round a child of about six, who was crying, and I asked the cause of his\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems that he was sent to walk in the Tuileries,\" said a mason, who\n",
      "was returning from his work with his trowel in his hand; \"the servant who\n",
      "took care of him met with some friends there, and told the child to wait\n",
      "for him while he went to get a drink; but I suppose the drink made him\n",
      "more thirsty, for he has not come back, and the child cannot find his way\n",
      "home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do they not ask him his name, and where he lives?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They have been doing it for the last hour; but all he can say is, that\n",
      "he is called Charles, and that his father is Monsieur Duval--there are\n",
      "twelve hundred Duvals in Paris.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then he does not know in what part of the town he lives?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should not think, indeed!  Don't you see that he is a gentleman's\n",
      "child?  He has never gone out except in a carriage or with a servant; he\n",
      "does not know what to do by himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the mason was interrupted by some of the voices rising above the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We cannot leave him in the street,\" said some.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The child-stealers would carry him off,\" continued others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must take him to the overseer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or to the police-office.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the thing.  Come, little one!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the child, frightened by these suggestions of danger, and at the\n",
      "names of police and overseer, cried louder, and drew back toward the\n",
      "parapet.  In vain they tried to persuade him; his fears made him resist\n",
      "the more, and the most eager began to get weary, when the voice of a\n",
      "little boy was heard through the confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know him well--I do,\" said he, looking at the lost child; \"he belongs\n",
      "in our part of the town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What part is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yonder, on the other side of the Boulevards--Rue des Magasins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you have seen him before?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes!  he belongs to the great house at the end of the street, where\n",
      "there is an iron gate with gilt points.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The child quickly raised his head, and stopped crying.  The little boy\n",
      "answered all the questions that were put to him, and gave such details as\n",
      "left no room for doubt.  The other child understood him, for he went up\n",
      "to him as if to put himself under his protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you can take him to his parents?\"  asked the mason, who had\n",
      "listened with real interest to the little boy's account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't care if I do,\" replied he; \"it's the way I'm going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you will take charge of him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has only to come with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, taking up the basket he had put down on the pavement, he set off\n",
      "toward the postern-gate of the Louvre.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lost child followed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope he will take him right,\" said I, when I saw them go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never fear,\" replied the mason; \"the little one in the blouse is the\n",
      "same age as the other; but, as the saying is, he knows black from white;'\n",
      "poverty, you see, is a famous schoolmistress!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The crowd dispersed.  For my part, I went toward the Louvre; the thought\n",
      "came into my head to follow the two children, so as to guard against any\n",
      "mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was not long in overtaking them; they were walking side by side,\n",
      "talking, and already quite familiar with each other.  The contrast in\n",
      "their dress then struck me.  Little Duval wore one of those fanciful\n",
      "children's dresses which are expensive as well as in good taste; his coat\n",
      "was skilfully fitted to his figure, his trousers came down in plaits from\n",
      "his waist to his boots of polished leather with mother-of-pearl buttons,\n",
      "and his ringlets were half hid by a velvet cap.  The appearance of his\n",
      "guide, on the contrary, was that of the class who dwell on the extreme\n",
      "borders of poverty, but who there maintain their ground with no\n",
      "surrender.  His old blouse, patched with pieces of different shades,\n",
      "indicated the perseverance of an industrious mother struggling against\n",
      "the wear and tear of time; his trousers were become too short, and showed\n",
      "his stockings darned over and over again; and it was evident that his\n",
      "shoes were not made for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The countenances of the two children were not less different than their\n",
      "dress.  That of the first was delicate and refined; his clear blue eye,\n",
      "his fair skin, and his smiling mouth gave him a charming look of\n",
      "innocence and happiness.  The features of the other, on the contrary, had\n",
      "something rough in them; his eye was quick and lively, his complexion\n",
      "dark, his smile less merry than shrewd; all showed a mind sharpened by\n",
      "too early experience; he walked boldly through the middle of the streets\n",
      "thronged by carriages, and followed their countless turnings without\n",
      "hesitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found, on asking him, that every day he carried dinner to his father,\n",
      "who was then working on the left bank of the Seine; and this responsible\n",
      "duty had made him careful and prudent.  He had learned those hard but\n",
      "forcible lessons of necessity which nothing can equal or supply the place\n",
      "of.  Unfortunately, the wants of his poor family had kept him from\n",
      "school, and he seemed to feel the loss; for he often stopped before the\n",
      "printshops, and asked his companion to read him the names of the\n",
      "engravings.  In this way we reached the Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle, which\n",
      "the little wanderer seemed to know again.  Notwithstanding his fatigue,\n",
      "he hurried on; he was agitated by mixed feelings; at the sight of his\n",
      "house he uttered a cry, and ran toward the iron gate with the gilt\n",
      "points; a lady who was standing at the entrance received him in her arms,\n",
      "and from the exclamations of joy, and the sound of kisses, I soon\n",
      "perceived she was his mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not seeing either the servant or child return, she had sent in search of\n",
      "them in every direction, and was waiting for them in intense anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "I explained to her in a few words what had happened.  She thanked me\n",
      "warmly, and looked round for the little boy who had recognized and\n",
      "brought back her son; but while we were talking, he had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was for the first time since then that I had come into this part of\n",
      "Paris.  Did the mother continue grateful?  Had the children met again,\n",
      "and had the happy chance of their first meeting lowered between them that\n",
      "barrier which may mark the different ranks of men, but should not divide\n",
      "them?\n",
      "\n",
      "While putting these questions to myself, I slackened my pace, and fixed\n",
      "my eyes on the great gate, which I just perceived.  Suddenly I saw it\n",
      "open, and two children appeared at the entrance.  Although much grown,\n",
      "I recognized them at first sight; they were the child who was found near\n",
      "the parapet of the Louvre, and his young guide.  But the dress of the\n",
      "latter was greatly changed: his blouse of gray cloth was neat, and even\n",
      "spruce, and was fastened round the waist by a polished leather belt; he\n",
      "wore strong shoes, but made for his feet, and had on a new cloth cap.\n",
      "Just at the moment I saw him, he held in his two hands an enormous bunch\n",
      "of lilacs, to which his companion was trying to add narcissuses and\n",
      "primroses; the two children laughed, and parted with a friendly good-by.\n",
      "M. Duval's son did not go in till he had seen the other turn the corner\n",
      "of the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I accosted the latter, and reminded him of our former meeting; he\n",
      "looked at me for a moment, and then seemed to recollect me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forgive me if I do not make you a bow,\" said he, merrily, \"but I want\n",
      "both my hands for the nosegay Monsieur Charles has given me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are, then, become great friends?\"  said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!  I should think so,\" said the child; \"and now my father is rich\n",
      "too!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How's that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Monsieur Duval lent him some money; he has taken a shop, where he works\n",
      "on his own account; and, as for me, I go to school.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied I, remarking for the first time the cross that decorated\n",
      "his little coat; \"and I see that you are head-boy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Monsieur Charles helps me to learn, and so I am come to be the first in\n",
      "the class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you now going to your lessons?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and he has given me some lilacs; for he has a garden where we play\n",
      "together, and where my mother can always have flowers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it is the same as if it were partly your own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it is!  Ah! they are good neighbors indeed.  But here I am; good-by,\n",
      "sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He nodded to me with a smile, and disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went on with my walk, still pensive, but with a feeling of relief.\n",
      "If I had elsewhere witnessed the painful contrast between affluence and\n",
      "want, here I had found the true union of riches and poverty.  Hearty\n",
      "good-will had smoothed down the more rugged inequalities on both sides,\n",
      "and had opened a road of true neighborhood and fellowship between the\n",
      "humble workshop and the stately mansion.  Instead of hearkening to the\n",
      "voice of interest, they had both listened to that of self-sacrifice,\n",
      "and there was no place left for contempt or envy.  Thus, instead of the\n",
      "beggar in rags, that I had seen at the other door cursing the rich man,\n",
      "I had found here the happy child of the laborer loaded with flowers and\n",
      "blessing him!  The problem, so difficult and so dangerous to examine into\n",

      "for shooting with the cross-bow.  I have always been struck by the spirit\n",
      "of these out-of-door festivities.  In drawing-room entertainments, people\n",

      "was cracked, was the same as those that are bought at the shops for\n",
      "sixpence!  Why should I destroy the illusions of her humble existence?\n",
      "Are we to break down the hedge-flowers that perfume our paths?  Things\n",
      "are oftenest nothing in themselves; the thoughts we attach to them alone\n",
      "give them value.  To rectify innocent mistakes, in order to recover some\n",

      "had brought with them.  I declined at first, but they insisted with so\n",
      "much good-nature, that I feared to pain them, and with some awkwardness\n",
      "gave way.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had only to look for a convenient spot.  I led them up the hill, and\n",
      "we found a plot of grass enamelled with daisies, and shaded by two\n",

      "\n",
      "Madeleine could not contain herself for joy.  All her life she had\n",

      "the provisions from the basket, she tells me of all her expeditions into\n",
      "the country that had been planned, and put off.  Frances, on the other\n",
      "hand, was brought up at Montmorency, and before she became an orphan she\n",
      "had often gone back to her nurse's house.  That which had the attraction\n",
      "of novelty for her sister, had for her the charm of recollection.  She\n",
      "told of the vintage harvests to which her parents had taken her; the\n",
      "rides on Mother Luret's donkey, that they could not make go to the right\n",
      "without pulling him to the left; the cherry-gathering; and the sails on\n",
      "the lake in the innkeeper's boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "These recollections have all the charm and freshness of childhood.\n",
      "Frances recalls to herself less what she has seen than what she has felt.\n",
      "While she is talking the cloth is laid, and we sit down under a tree.\n",
      "Before us winds the valley of Sevres, its many-storied houses abutting\n",
      "upon the gardens and the slopes of the hill; on the other side spreads\n",
      "out the park of St. Cloud, with its magnificent clumps of trees\n",
      "interspersed with meadows; above stretch the heavens like an immense\n",
      "ocean, in which the clouds are sailing!  I look at this beautiful\n",
      "country, and I listen to these good old maids; I admire, and I am\n",
      "interested; and time passes gently on without my perceiving it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the sun sets, and we have to think of returning.  While Madeleine\n",
      "and Frances clear away the dinner, I walk down to the manufactory to ask\n",
      "the hour.  The merrymaking is at its height; the blasts of the trombones\n",
      "resound from the band under the acacias.  For a few moments I forget\n",
      "myself with looking about; but I have promised the two sisters to take\n",
      "them back to the Bellevue station; the train cannot wait, and I make\n",
      "haste to climb the path again which leads to the walnut-trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just before I reached them, I heard voices on the other side of the\n",
      "hedge.  Madeleine and Frances were speaking to a poor girl whose clothes\n",
      "were burned, her hands blackened, and her face tied up with bloodstained\n",
      "bandages.  I saw that she was one of the girls employed at the gunpowder\n",
      "mills, which are built further up on the common.  An explosion had taken\n",
      "place a few days before; the girl's mother and elder sister were killed;\n",
      "she herself escaped by a miracle, and was now left without any means of\n",
      "support.  She told all this with the resigned and unhopeful manner of one\n",
      "who has always been accustomed to suffer.  The two sisters were much\n",
      "affected; I saw them consulting with each other in a low tone: then\n",
      "Frances took thirty sous out of a little coarse silk purse, which was all\n",
      "they had left, and gave them to the poor girl.  I hastened on to that\n",
      "side of the hedge; but, before I reached it, I met the two old sisters,\n",
      "who called out to me that they would not return by the railway, but on\n",
